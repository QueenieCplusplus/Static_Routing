# IP Routing CLI

$no ip routing

$ip routing

R1$show interfaces ethernet 0

> Ethernet0 is up, line protocol is up

The hosts that are connected to segments interconnected with a single Router must have Routes pointing to the IP addr assigned on the router interfaces.


               --------------------
              |                    |
    HostA ----|                    |
              |                    |
              |                    |
    HostB ----|       Segment      |-default Route -> IP addr of Interface of Router
              |                    |
              |                    |
    HostC ----|                    |
              |                    |
               --------------------


For instance, all of the hosts on a segment can have a single Route pointing to IP addr of the Router's interface which is attached to the segment.

R2$show ip route

> 10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 2 subnets

> C 10.2.2.0 is directly connected. TokenRing0

> C 10.0.255.0 is directly connected. Serial1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Static Route

to identify the network Prefixes of the networks that are Accessible thru other Routers. Then create Static Route for segements.

There are an important consideration is that host config, it then has entry point to the appropriate interface of the routers, then to create static routing on the closest router. Remember to config 2 sides to avoid errors.

        R2$ip route <remote IP addr> <subnetmask> <next hop Router>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default Route Config & Individual Host Route

for host route

however this ip addr is assigned for not only the host per se, can be addr of other router.

      h3$ip route <remote IP addr> <subnetmask> <next hop Router>

to check by

      h3$show ip route
      > then show routing table
      
for default route

      R0$ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next hop router>
      R0$ip classless
      R0$ip classless

to check by

      R0$debug ip packet
      R0$ping <ip addr>
