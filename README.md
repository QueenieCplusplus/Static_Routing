The hosts that are connected to segments interconnected with a single Router must have Routes pointing to the IP addr assigned on the router interfaces.


               --------------------
              |                    |
    HostA ----|                    |
              |                    |
              |                    |
    HostB ----|       Segment      |-default Route -> IP addr of Interface of Router
              |                    |
              |                    |
    HostC ----|                    |
              |                    |
               --------------------


For instance, all of the hosts on a segment can have a single Route pointing to IP addr of the Router's interface which is attached to the segment.

R2$show ip route

> 10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 2 subnets

> C 10.2.2.0 is directly connected. TokenRing0

> C 10.0.255.0 is directly connected. Serial1
